# Done

* devise a simple mechanism to generate emerging self-organization out of simple rules
* develop a web app usinf mentioned mechanism
* add UI controlls to modify the input values
* add controls for reset and randomize
* format the configuration file of a simulation run
* add save/load of configuraation capability for the app
* define metrics for emerging behaviours
* time series visualisation of the metrics
* API access point
* test API page
* documentation of the project
* API access workflow

# Current

* automation of the API workflow

# To Do

* define values of the metrics corresponding to emerging behaviour of interest
* space search through the automated API system for the proper configuration of the mentioned behaviours
* collect the set of mentioned configurations
* use automated (decision-tree-like) analysis of the mentioned set to extract knowledge on common features of self-organizing configurations
* analyse, draw conclusions, generalise knowledge
